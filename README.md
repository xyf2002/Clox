# Clox VM Implementation in C

This repository contains an implementation of the Clox virtual machine, as described in the book "Crafting Interpreters" by Robert Nystrom. Clox is a bytecode virtual machine for a language called Lox, and this project focuses on implementing it using the C programming language.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Source files for the virtual machine.
- `include/`: Header files for the virtual machine.
- `tests/`: Test scripts and programs written in Lox.
- `Makefile`: Build instructions for the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have `gcc` or `clang` installed on your system. You can check this by running:
```bash
gcc --version
clang --version
